## [1.0.2] - 2019-11-19

### Added

- `trash(id: ID!): Page!` field allows to move pages to trash via GraphQL api.
- Solves N+1 problem for FieldtypePage field. Significantly improves response speed!
- Support for `FieldtypeRepeater`.
- Support for even more ProcessWire permissions:
  - `page-add`
  - `page-create`
  - `page-delete`
  - `page-edit`
  - `page-move`
  - `page-view`
  - `page-edit-created`
  - `page-edit-trash-created`

### Changed

- The module was rewritten to use [webonyx/graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php) instead of [youshido/graphql](https://github.com/youshido/graphql).
- `ProcessGraphQL->executeGraphQL` now returns an array. You'll need to convert it to JSON before sending it to the client. You can use `json_encode` php method for that.
- "updatePage" fields no longer accept the `id` argument. You have to pass the page's id you want to update into page argument of the "updatePage" field.
- The lowest version of PHP is 7.1 is required.
- If you had used a third-party module to support additional PW fields for GraphQL, then they are no longer going to work. You'll have to update them to use [webonyx/graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php).
- If you used `GraphqlFieldtypeMapMarker` module, you need to update it to the latest [version available](https://github.com/dadish/GraphQLFieldtypeMapMarker/archive/master.zip).

### Removed

- The following fields are removed and no longer will be available for Page object types.
  - `find`
  - `next`
  - `prev`
  - `rootParent`
  - `siblings`
- An experimental `pages` field is dropped and no longer supported.
- No more __Grant Templates Access__ and __Grant Fields Access__ options. You now have to explicitly set access permissions to all the templates and fields you want to serve via GraphQL.

## [0.17.0] - 2018-02-14

This release introduces lots of changes to repository structure and development process.

### Changed

- The main branch no longer tracks the vendor directory. This means that it is not suitable as a ProcessWire module. Instead you need to use [latest release][latest-release] tags as a ProcessWire module. Release branches are a minified version of this module that includes everything needed and works out of the box. The main branch is used for development.
- Now we have a Continious Integration implemented. [![Build Status][travis-ci-badge]][travis-ci] This means that people can contribute confidently by running test suite and be sure that nothing has broken and a pull-request will be merged.
- `$ProcessGraphQL->executeGraphQL` now accepts `payload` & `variables` as an argument. This allows you to modify the payload from client and manually pass it to the module to meet your needs.
